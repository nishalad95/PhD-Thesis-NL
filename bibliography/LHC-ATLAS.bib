abstract = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.}

% Gauge Theories of the Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic Interactions
@book{gauge-theories,
 ISBN = {0691135487},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgx94},
 abstract = {This completely revised and updated graduate-level textbook is
an ideal introduction to gauge theories and their applications to
high-energy particle physics, and takes an in-depth look at two new
laws of nature--quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory.
From quantum electrodynamics through unified theories of the
interactions among leptons and quarks, Chris Quigg examines the
logic and structure behind gauge theories and the experimental
underpinnings of today's theories. Quigg emphasizes how we know
what we know, and in the era of the Large Hadron Collider, his
insightful survey of the standard model and the next great
questions for particle physics makes for compelling reading.The brand-new edition shows how the electroweak theory developed
in conversation with experiment. Featuring a wide-ranging treatment
of electroweak symmetry breaking, the physics of the Higgs boson,
and the importance of the 1-TeV scale, the book moves beyond
established knowledge and investigates the path toward unified
theories of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.
Explicit calculations and diverse exercises allow readers to derive
the consequences of these theories. Extensive annotated
bibliographies accompany each chapter, amplify points of conceptual
or technical interest, introduce further applications, and lead
readers to the research literature. Students and seasoned
practitioners will profit from the text's current insights, and
specialists wishing to understand gauge theories will find the book
an ideal reference for self-study.
Brand-new edition of a landmark text introducing gauge
theories

Consistent attention to how we know what we know

Explicit calculations develop concepts and engage with
experiment

Interesting and diverse problems sharpen skills and ideas

Beginning with an account of particle physics in the years after the Second World War, I describe early attempts at constructing a unified theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the obstacles encountered and how they were eventually overcome with the mass-generating mechanism incorporating the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking, one of whose features is the now-famous Higgs boson. }

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {While many high energy experiments use track fitting software that is based solely on the Kalman Filter technique, the ATLAS offline reconstruction also has several global track fitters available. One of these is the GlobalChi2Fitter, which is based on the scattering angle formulation of the track fit. One of the advantages of this method over the Kalman fit is that it can provide the scattering angles and related quantities (e.g. the residual derivatives) to the alignment algorithms. The algorithm has been implemented in the new common tracking framework in ATLAS, the philosophy of which is to improve the modularity and flexibility of the tracking software. This flexibility has proven crucial for the understanding of the data from the testbeam and cosmic runs. An overview of recent results will be presented, in particular the results from the combined tracking with the inner detector and the muon spectrometer using the cosmics data.}

  abstract  = "The standard model of particle physics is remarkably successful
               because it is consistent with (almost) all experimental results.
               However, it fails to explain dark matter, dark energy and the
               imbalance between matter and antimatter in the Universe. Because
               discrepancies between standard-model predictions and
               experimental observations may provide evidence of new physics,
               an accurate evaluation of these predictions requires highly
               precise values of the fundamental physical constants. Among
               them, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is of particular
               importance because it sets the strength of the electromagnetic
               interaction between light and charged elementary particles, such
               as the electron and the muon. Here we use matter-wave
               interferometry to measure the recoil velocity of a rubidium atom
               that absorbs a photon, and determine the fine-structure constant
               $\alpha$-1 = 137.035999206(11) with a relative accuracy of 81
               parts per trillion. The accuracy of eleven digits in $\alpha$
               leads to an electron g factor1,2-the most precise prediction of
               the standard model-that has a greatly reduced uncertainty. Our
               value of the fine-structure constant differs by more than 5
               standard deviations from the best available result from caesium
               recoil measurements3. Our result modifies the constraints on
               possible candidate dark-matter particles proposed to explain the
               anomalous decays of excited states of 8Be nuclei4 and paves the
               way for testing the discrepancy observed in the magnetic moment
               anomaly of the muon5 in the electron sector6.",

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The track finding algorithm adopted for the LHC Run-2 data taking period is based on combinatorial track following, where the number of seeds scales non-linearly with the number of hits. The corresponding CPU time increase, close to cubical, creates huge and ever-increasing demand for computing power. This is particularly problematic for the silicon tracking detectors, where the hit occupancy is the largest. Therefore, it is essential that resource use is reduced, whilst maintaining the ability to reconstruct tracks with minimal loss in efficiency. This paper briefly summarises the work that has been done to optimise the HLT ID track seeding software for ATLAS Run-3 and beyond, in order to reduce the number of fake seeds constructed. An ML-based algorithm has been developed to predict if a pair of hits belong to the same track given input hit features, focusing on cluster width and inverse track inclination. The implementation of the trained predictor in the form of Look-Up Tables is presented, along with performance results in terms of tracking efficiency and speed-up factor using simulated data.}

The number of filters is kept small by a suitable collapsing procedure. We report results on the precision of the estimated track parameters and on the computational load required by the algorithm with non-Gaussian observation errors. We also develop the correct smoothing algorithm and discuss the treatment of non-Gaussian process noise.}
